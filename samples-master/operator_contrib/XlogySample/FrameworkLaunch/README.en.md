## Overview
This example is based on the Xlogy operator project and introduces the invocation method for single operator calls.

## Directory Structure Introduction
``` 
├── FrameworkLaunch           // Invokes the Xlogy operator using the framework
│   ├── AclNNInvocation       // Invocation of the Xlogy operator via aclnn
│   ├── Xlogy                 // Xlogy operator project
│   └── Xlogy.json            // Prototype definition json file for the Xlogy operator
``` 

## Operator Project Introduction
The operator project directory Xlogy contains template files for operator implementation, compilation scripts, etc., as shown below:
``` 
├── Xlogy               // Xlogy custom operator project
│   ├── cmake
│   ├── framework           // Directory for operator plugin implementation files, not required for single operator model generation
│   ├── op_host             // Host-side implementation files
│   ├── op_kernel           // Kernel-side implementation files
│   ├── scripts             // Directory for custom operator project packaging scripts
│   ├── build.sh            // Compilation entry script
│   ├── CMakeLists.txt      // CMakeLists.txt for the operator project
│   └── CMakePresets.json   // Compilation configuration items
``` 
The CANN software package provides the project creation tool msopgen. The Xlogy operator project can be automatically created from Xlogy.json. For details, please refer to the [Ascend C Operator Development](https://hiascend.com/document/redirect/CannCommunityOpdevAscendC) > Operator Development > Operator Development Project > Operator Development Based on Custom Operator Project > Creating Operator Project section.

## Compiling and Running the Example Operator
For custom operator projects, the compilation and running process includes the following steps:
- Compile the custom operator project to generate the operator installation package;
- Install the custom operator into the operator library;
- Invoke and execute the custom operator;

Detailed operations are as follows.

### 1. Obtain the Source Code Package
Before compiling and running this example, please refer to [Preparation: Obtain the Example Code](../README.en.md#codeready) to obtain the source code package.

### 2. Compile the Operator Project<a name="operatorcompile"></a>
Compile the custom operator project to build and generate the custom operator package.

- Execute the following command to switch to the Xlogy operator project directory.

  ```bash
  cd ${git_clone_path}/samples/operator_contrib/XlogySample/FrameworkLaunch/Xlogy
  ```

- Modify the ASCEND_CANN_PACKAGE_PATH in CMakePresets.json to the actual path after the CANN software package is installed.

  ```json
  {
      ……
      "configurePresets": [
          {
                  ……
                  "ASCEND_CANN_PACKAGE_PATH": {
                      "type": "PATH",
                      "value": "/usr/local/Ascend/ascend-toolkit/latest"   // Please replace with the actual path after the CANN software package is installed. eg: /home/HwHiAiUser/Ascend/ascend-toolkit/latest
                  },
                  ……
          }
      ]
  }
  ```

- Execute the following command in the Xlogy operator project directory to compile the operator project.

  ```bash
  ./build.sh
  ```
After successful compilation, the build_out directory will be created in the current directory, and the custom operator installation package custom_opp_\<target os>_\<target architecture>.run will be generated in the build_out directory, for example, "custom_opp_ubuntu_x86_64.run".

Note: If you want to use the dump debugging function, you need to remove the configurations for Atlas training series products and Atlas 200/500 A2 inference products in op_host and CMakeLists.txt.

### 3. Deploy the Operator Package

Execute the following command to install the custom operator package in the path where the custom operator installation package is located.
  ```bash
  cd build_out
  ./custom_opp_<target os>_<target architecture>.run
  ```
After the command is successfully executed, the relevant files in the custom operator package will be deployed to the vendors/customize directory of the OPP operator library in the current environment.

### 4. Configure Environment Variables

Please select the corresponding command to configure environment variables based on the [installation method](https://hiascend.com/document/redirect/CannCommunityInstSoftware) of the CANN development toolkit package on the current environment.
- Default path, root user installs CANN software package
  ```bash
  export ASCEND_INSTALL_PATH=/usr/local/Ascend/ascend-toolkit/latest
  ```
- Default path, non-root user installs CANN software package
  ```bash
  export ASCEND_INSTALL_PATH=$HOME/Ascend/ascend-toolkit/latest
  ```
- Specified path install_path, installs CANN software package
  ```bash
  export ASCEND_INSTALL_PATH=${install_path}/ascend-toolkit/latest
  ```

### 5. Invoke and Execute the Operator Project
- [Invoke the Xlogy Operator Project using aclnn](./AclNNInvocation/README.en.md)
